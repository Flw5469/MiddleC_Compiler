R1 default (EAP) and R2 (any other)

"6","+","4","/","2","+","1","/","1" "*" "7"
=> 
===
DFS left: load 6 into R1, 
me: put 6 into stack
DFS right: load 4 into R1, divide by 2, put into R1
me: put 6 from stack into R2
do operations of R1 and R2, result will be in R1
===


6 + 4
-> in rule 
expression: expression, operator_with_expression
expression: expression, operator_with_value
1. +4 can only be interepted as operator_with_value, because 4 is just a value, cannot convert into expression
2. no need the excessive load :D

6 + 3 * 5
1. expression: expression, operator_with_expression is used.
2. after 6, R1 is loaded.
3. before going to 3*5, R1 is pushed
4. after going to 3*5, R1 (result of 3*5) is stored to R2, since it is the second operand.
5. after going to 3*5, previous stored R1 (result of 6) is pop back in.
